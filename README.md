# INFX-576-BI-Systems-Presentation

Powerpoint Presentation of the BI system and dashboard I developed for a class in graduate school. Information from a 3 normal SQL Server database and an Excel flat file were pulled into a star schema based data warehouse that I designed so that queries would optimized for the users. SQL views were created as well to better display data, and a user-tested Tableau dashboard was pointed at the data warehouse to users could view live data quickly and easily from the dashboard display.
